```

1. 动名词作主语，通常用以表示已知的事实或曾经做过的经历

#### 名词性从句作主语

可作主语、宾语或在be动词之后作表语。名词性从句的种类:

```
名词性从句包括宾语从句、主语从句、表语从句、同位语从句。名词性从句一共有三种:
l ) that从句
2 ) whether从句
3）疑问词所引导的从句
```

##### that从句

```
任何-个主语起首的句子：

他不读书令我生气
he doesn't study makes me angry.
-> That he doesn't study makes me angry.
他不相信我说的话
That he doesn't believe my words.
有很多工作要做
That there is lot of work to do.
```

##### whether从句

```
可用yes/no回答的问句变化而成：

a）问句有be动词时：
他是否快乐
Is he happy? 
-> whether he is happy

b）问句有一般助动词（Can、will、may、should、ought to、must、have）时，主语与助动词还原，前面冠以whether：

他是否能做这件事
Can he do it? 
-> whether he can do it.

他是否已做好此事
Has he done it?
-> Whether he has done it.

c）问句有do、does、did等助动词时主语与助动词还原，再将do、does、did去掉，后面的动词依人称和时态变化:

他是否来了
Did he come? 
-> whether he came.

他是否喜欢它
Does he like it? 
-> whether he likes it.
```

##### 疑问词所引导的从句

本从句系由疑问词（when、what、how、where、why）等引导的问句变化而成，这种由疑问词引导的问句称为特殊疑问句。

1. 问句有be动词时：

```
主语与be动词还原，前面保留疑问词。

他正在做什么
What is he doing? 
-> what he is doing.
```

2. 问句有一般助动词时：

```
主语与助动词还原，前面保留疑问词。

他在哪里能找到它
Where can he find it? 
-> where he can find it.
```

3. 问句有do、does、did等助动词时：

```
主语与助动词还原前面保留疑问词，再将do、does、did去掉，动词依人称和时态变化。

他写什么
What did he write? 
-> what he wrote.

他何时来
When did he come? 
-> when he came.

他怎么做这件事
How does he do it? 
-> how he does it.

who/what/which为疑问代词，若在问句中作主语，变成名词性从句时结构不变:

谁来这儿
Who came here? 
-> who came here.

昨晚发生什么事
What happended last night? 
-> what happended last night.

哪个被买走
Which was bought? 
-> which was bought.
```

名词性从句的功能:

1. 名词性从句作主语：

```
“诚实为上策”是一句我们应时刻谨记在心的蔑言
That honesty is the best policy is a proverb (which) we should always keep in mind.
=It's a proverb we should always keep in mind that honesty is the best policy.

他住哪里仍不确定
 Where he lives is still in doubt.
=It's still in doubt where he lives.

他能胜任与否仍有待观察
 Whether he can do it remains to be seen.
=It remains to be seen whether he can do it.
```

2. 名词性从句作及物动词的宾语：

及物动词在英文中称作transitive veth，简写为vt.；宾语则称作object，简写为o．

```
我知道他最近即将出国
I know that he will go abroad in the near future.

我想知道他是否已做完这份工作
I wonder whether he has finished the work.

我不知道他将如何处理这件事
I don't know how he'll handle it.
```

3. 作介词的宾语：

介词在英文中称作preposition，简写成prep.

```
a）此时仅能用whether从句或疑问词引导的名词性从句作宾语· that从句不可作介词的宾语。
我很担心他是否能做这件事
I am worried about whether he can do it.

我很好奇他将如何应付这问题
I am curious about how he'll cope with the problem.

b）遇有介词，且非要使用that从句时其补救方法如下：

(1) 介词+the fact+that从句:
建议使用:
我确定这一队赢了这场比赛
I am sure of that the team has won the game.(x)
I am sure of the fact that the team has won the game.(the fact that).

我担心他不念书
I am worry about that he doesn't study.(x)
I am worry about the fact that he doesn't study.

(2) 保留介词，不加the fact但介词之后的that从句要做下列变化:
第一步：除去that;
第二步：that后的主语变成所有格；
第三步：动词变成动名词。
不常用:
I am worried about that he plays around all day.(x)
I am worried about the fact that he plays around all day.
I am worried about his(or him) playing around all day.

(a) that从句若有助动词do、does、did时，予以去掉即可。
I am worried about that he doens't study.(x)
I am worried about his not study.

(b) that从句若有助动词will或would时，予以去掉即可。
我确信这一队会赢得这场比赛。
I am sure of that the team will win the game.(x)
I am sure of the team's winning the game.

(c) 从句若有以下助动词时，做下列变化：
may -> be likely to
can -> be able to
我很高兴他可能会来。
I am happy about that he may come.(x)
I am happy about his being likely to come.
我确定他能做这件事。
I am sure of that he can do it.(x)
I am surce of his being able to do it.

(3) be + adj. + that从句：
也就是去掉介词，将that从句放在形容词后面，作其宾语。
建议使用
I am worried about that he plays around all day.(x)
I am worried that he plays around all day.

有时介词之后亦可直接接that从句而不需the fact，形成惯用语，亦应牢记。
in that=because    因为
他很有才华，因为他能说五种语言。
He is talented in that he can speak five different languages.

except that    只可惜、除了
他人很不错，只可惜有时会说谎。
He is nice except that sometimes he tell lies.

=despite the fact that    尽管
=in spite of the fact that
尽管他人好，我却不喜欢他。
Despite the fact that he is nice, I don't like him.
```

##### 名词短语作主语

名词短语系由“疑问词＋不定式短语”形成。

1. 疑问副词

```
where to live           住哪里
whether to try again    是否再试一次
when to talk to him     什么时候和他谈
how to do it            如何做那事
```

2. 疑问代词

```
what to do      做什么

=Where to meet him is not decided yet.

我们如何处理这问题要视我们能募集到多少钱而定。
How we can handle the problem depends on how much money we can collect.
How to handle the problem depends on how much money we can collect.
```

##### 表距离的地方副词短语作主语

from+地方名词+to+地方名词:
此为表距离的地方副词短语，亦可作主语，与单数的be动词连用。

```
 From A to B is about 1000 km.
=It's about 1000 km from A to B.

从上海到北京大约1000公里
From Shanghai to Beijing about 1000 kilometers.
It's about 1000 kilometers From Shanghai to Beijing. 
```

### 动词的种类及其用法

#### 动词（verb）基本上可分为五大类

```
a．完全不及物动词：
(complete Intransitive veth，简写：c.vi.)
b．不完全不及物动词：
(incomplete Intransitive veth，简写：i.vi.)
c．完全及物动词：
(complete transitive verb，简写：c.vt.)
d．不完全及物动词；
(incomplete tra力sitive verb，简写：i.vt.)
e．授与动词：
(dative verb简写：d.v.)
```

#### 如何判断完全不及物动词

是否及物动词的判断, 以下翻译成中文若无毛病，就是及物动词，否则就是不及物动词，准确率高达99%：
```
我___他(主动)
他被我__(被动)
```

```
He wrote the book.
The book was written by him.
Something happened.
```

#### be动词

```

My trouble is that I lack money.
问题是他是否能加人我们。
The problem is whether he can join us.

3）名词短语：
问题是何时出发

4）作名词用的动名词短语：

8）作形容词用的过去分词：

9）作形容词用的介词短语：
此类介词短语由“ of＋抽象名词”形成。

10）地方副词：

11）地方副词短语：
她人在城里。

```

be动词之后的现在分词有两种词性：

一作形容词，一作动词进行时的现在分词。换言之，同学遇到v-ing；可译成"⋯的"时，就是作形容词的现在分词，否则就是表“进行状态”的现在分词，要译成“正在⋯”，而不视为形容词。

```
这女孩很迷人
The girl is charming.
这女孩在唱歌。
The girl is singing.
```

be动词之后的过去分词亦有两个词性：

一作形容词用，可译成“感到⋯的”；一作及物动词的被动语态，译成“被而不视为形容词。

```
这个人很累
The man is tired.
这男的被杀了
The man was killed.
```

#### become

become可用任何名词、形容词或可作形容词用的现在分词或过去分词（即可以译成“ ⋯ ⋯的”之类的分词）作表语。

```
他生气了。
He become angry.
如果你用功，就可成为好学生。
If you study hard, you will become a good student.
她愈来愈迷人。

turn通常只用形容词作表语，而且所能使用的形容词多与颜色或情绪有关。

```
听到那消息时，他脸色变得苍白起来。
His face turns pale when he heard the news.
树叶变黄了。
The leaves were turning yellow.
看到玛丽时，他气得脸都红了。
His face turned red with angry when he saw Mary.

```
他生气了。
He got mad.
她愈来愈美丽。
She is getting more and more beautiful.
事情愈来愈顺利。
Things are getting better and better.
她变漂亮了

If you are not careful, you will get hurt.
```

#### seem

=He seems happy.(to be可以省略掉)
他似乎是个好人

```

#### 感观动词

感官动词一共有五个，一律译成“⋯起来”，之后一律用形容词（或可作形容词用的分词）作表语。

```

我现在觉得很疲倦

like为介词译成“像”，之后的名词为其宾语。

听起来像是个好主意
It sounds like a good idea.
那质料摸起来像丝
The material fells like silk.
这食物尝起来像鱼肉

```

3. feel like + noun: 感觉像

When Jane said she would marry me, I feel like a newborn baby
我今天想散散步

4. feel、taste、smell亦可当完全及物动词，可用名词作宾语。

他愉快地看着我

```

### 完全及物动词的用法

完全及物动词的宾语，计有名词、代词、不定式、动名词、名词性从句及名词短语等。同学稍加注意，就可发现这些词类、短语或从句均有名词的特性，故亦可用作主语。

1. 名词当及物动词的宾语

```

He didn't buy that car.
```

2. 代词当及物动词的宾语

```
我不喜欢约翰。事实上，我讨厌他

```

3. 不定式当及物动词的宾语

这些动词皆有表示某种愿望、企图之意，常用的此类动词如：want（想要）、hope（希望）、 desire（想要）等。

```
我现在就要见他
I want to see him now.
我希望有一天能出国留学
I hope to study abroad someday.
```

4. 动名词当及物动词的宾语

并非所有及物动词均可用动名词作宾语。常以动名词作宾语的动词有下列几个：

```
considered/imagined/fancy/risked/avoided/escaped/suggested/
recommended/enjoy/resent/practiced/stopped/quit/mind

他考虑出国念书

他继续在赌场里试他的手气。
He continued trying(/to try) his luck at the casino.
他们开始建这栋房子
They start building(/to build) the house.
```

#### 名词性从句作及物动词的宾语

```
名词性从句有三种：
1) that引导的名词性从句
that he can't do it   （他不能做此事）
2) whether引导的名词性从句
whether he will come  （他是否会来）
3) 疑问词引导的名同性从句
when he will do it    （他何时做）
what he is doing      （他正在做什么）
how he'll handle it   （他如何处理此事）

为了方便记忆起见，我们可将名词性从句记成“戴慧怡” 。
戴：即that之讹音
慧：即whether第一音节之讹音
怡：即疑问词从句“疑”之同音词

由于名词性从句具有名词的功能，故亦可作及物动词的宾语。

我相信他是个言而有信的人
He believ that he is a man of his word.
我不知道他是否能够做此事
I don't know whether he can do it.
我不知道他住哪里
I don't know where he lives.

that从句作及物动词的宾语时，名词性从句连接词that通常予以省略。
他们觉得不可能赢这场比赛
They feel (that) it's impossible to win the game.
他认为这本书值得一读
He think (that) the book is worth reading.

whether从句作及物动词的宾语时，名词性从句连接词whether亦可被if取代。
我不知道台风是否会来。
I don't know whether the typhoon will come
=I don't know if the typhoon will come.
我不知道这个人是否有足够的能力处理此事。
I don't know if the man has enough ability to handle the it.
I doubt if the man is competent enough to handle it.
```

但whether从句若作主语、介词的宾语或者be动词后的表语时，不能用if:

```
a. whether从句作主语：
他是否能去还不知道。
Whether he can go is not yet know.
b. whether从句作介词的宾语：
他很担心是否能通过这次考试。
He is worried about whether he can pass the exam.
c. whether从句作be动词后的表语：
The problem is whether he has enough money for the trip.
```

#### 名词短语
```
我知道如何处理这问题。
I know how to handle the problem.
我不知道该向谁说。
I don't know whom to talk to.
```

#### 不完全及物动词

```
本句意思不完全，故需补语。
他使玛丽快乐。
He made me happy.
```

#### 使役动词

1. 叫

make/have + 宾语 + 原形动词

```
我叫他洗车
I made him wash the car.
I had him wash the car.
I got him to wash the car.
我叫约翰向我报到。
I had John report to me.
```

get亦可表“叫⋯ ”之意，但只能用不定式短语作宾语补语，句型如下：
get sb to V    叫某人从事⋯

```
我叫他洗车。
I got him wash the car.
```

make可使用于被动语态中但have及get则不可。

主动语态：
```
I made(had) him wash the car.
I got him to wash the car.
```

被动语态:

变被动语态时，原形动词wash就要变成不定式短语to wash，而成to wash the car。
have、get无被动用法。
```
他被要求洗车
He was made to wash the car.
```


2. 让


```
a. let＋宾语＋原形动词（作宾语补语）
我让他洗车
I let him wash the car.
我让彼得试试看
I let Peter try it.

b. let＋宾语＋作副词用的介词（in、out、down)
他让我进来
He let me in.
别让他出去
Don't let him out.
他的表演令我失望
His performance let me down.

上述介词由于其后无宾语，可单独存在作副词用，因此称为介副词。与
地方副词（如there 、 here 、 home）一样，介副词可作be动词之后的
表语:
他在家
He is in
He is out
He is there.
He is here.
He is home.
He is downtown.
He is in the house.
```

3. 强迫/要求/怂恿/催促

此类动词＋宾语＋不定式短语（作宾语补语）
force/ask/encourage/tell+不定式

```
我强迫他背这课
I forced him to recite the lesson.
我要求他写这封信
I asked him to write the lettle.
我鼓励他更努力些
I encouraged him to work harder.
他强迫我做违反意愿的事
He forced me to do it against my will.
他叫我10点钟以前做完这件工作
He told me to finish the work by 10.

此类动词尚有许多个，兹将常出现的此类动词列举如下：
push one to...    （催促某人去⋯ ⋯）
expect one to...  （期望某人去⋯ ⋯）
want one to...    （要某人去⋯ ⋯）
```

4. 使...成为

此类动词只有make一个，加了宾语之后，要用形容词或名词作补语:

主语+make+宾语+形容词(或名词)（作宾语补语）
```
他的老师使他成为好学生
His teacher made him a good student.
这次旅行使他很愉快
The trip made him happy.
```

#### 知觉动词

此类动词有三类：
看：see、observe（观察）、watch（看）、lookat（注视）、notice（注意）
听：hear、listen to
感觉：feel

1. 此类动词可作完全及物动词，加了宾语之后无须另加补语

```
你看见他没有
Did you see him?
他正在听音乐
he was listening music.
我觉得背痛
I felt a pain in my back.
```

2. 但此类动词亦可作不完全及物动词，加了宾语之后，须另加宾语补语。用法如下：

```
a. 表事实时，用原形动词作补语，译成“...了”
我看见他跳舞了
I saw him dance.
我听见他唱歌了
I heard him sing.
我感觉到他动了
I felt him move.

b. 表进行状态时，用现在分词作补语，译成“...正在...”

我推开门时，听见他正在唱歌
I heard him singing when I pushed the door open.
As I pushed the door open, I heard him singing.
门铃响时，我感觉到我的双腿正在发抖。

c. 表被动状态时，要用过去分词作补语，译成"...被..."
我看见他被杀死了
I saw him killed.
我听见门被关起来了
I heard the door closed.
我感觉到自己被举起来了
I felt myself lifted.
```

#### 认定动词

此类动词均表“视⋯为”之意，加了宾语之后，用名词或形容词作宾语补语。

1. 与介词连用者：
视...为：与as或for连用：

```
我们都把他视为天才
We regard(look upon/think of/see/view) him as a genius.
我误将那长发的男孩视作女孩
I mistook the long-haired boy for a girl.
```

2. 与to be连用者：

```
我们认为他是天才／人很好。
We consider/deem/think him to be a genius.
We consider/deem/think him a genius.
We consider/deem/think him to be nice.
We consider/deem/think him nice.

a. 一般介词之后只能用名词、代词或动名词作宾语
我很讨厌他粗鲁的态度
I am sick of his rude attitude.
我讨厌与他为伍
I am sick of associating with him.

但表“视...为”的动词与as或for连用时，它们之后除可接名词外，亦可直接接形容词作补语。
我认为他的行为不当
I regard his behavior as inappropriate.

b. think、believe、find、deem、consider等五个动词作不完全及物动词时，
不得直接用不定式短语作宾语，一定要用形式宾语it取代。此时think
译成"认为⋯是⋯"、 deem译成“认为...是..."、consider译成“认为...是...” 
主语+think(believe/find/deem/consider)+it+宾语补语(n. or adj.)+to V.
我认为爬山是很有趣的―我认为爬山很有趣。
I think it fun to climb the mountains.
我发觉做这件事是有必要的―我发觉做这事有必要
I find it necesssary to do the work.
我相信用功是值得的―我相信用功很值得。
I believe it worthwhile to study hard.

但find、believe、think、deem、consider也可作完全及物动词
此时要用that引导的名词性从句作宾语。此时find、believe、thlnk、
deem、consider分别译成“发现、相信、认为，认为、认为” 。
我认为爬山很有趣
I think that it's interesting to climb the mountains.
我相信用功是值得的
I believee that it's worthwhile to study hard.

c. make表“使...成为...”时，亦为不完全及物动词，其后不得用不定式
短语作宾语，一定要用形式宾语it取代。
```

make: 使...成为...:

```
He make it a rule to get up early.
Hard work made it possible for him to win the honor.
```

#### 转变动词

使...变成...: change/turn，与into连用：

```
The experience turned/changed him into a good student.
```

#### 授予动词

```
I'll give you this watch.
Please lend me your book.
I gave him the book.
=I gave the book to him.

#代劳
I bought him the book.
=I bought the book for him.

#从...中
I asked him a question.
=I asked a question of him.

#表提供：offer/provide/supply/furnish/present, 除offer外，要与with连用
He offered me all I needed.
=He provided me with all I needed.

#explan/introduce/propose/recommend/express要与to连用
He recommended the method to me.

#我拍了-张他的照片
I took a picture of him.
#我为他拍了-张照片
I took a picture for him.
```

#### 其他

```
Never try it.
=Don't ever try it.

#How之后只能与单数名词, what没有限制. 只记how+adj，what+noun就可以
What a great man he is!
=How great he is!=How great a man he is!
How hard he studied!
```

```

I like the book which he bought yesterday.
This is my mother, who loves me very much.(对)

```

#### 关系代词的省略

限制性定语从句中，若关系代词为及物动词的宾语，则该关系代词可省略。若关系代词为介词的宾语，介词移到定语从句的句尾时，则该关系代词可省略。

```
This is the boy whom I saw yesterday.(vt)

This is the knife whth which he killed Marry.(有with，不能用that取代which)

```

下列情况下，只能用that

序数词：the first/second.../last

```

最高级后，只能用that：

that is->being->省略
=Who is that boy standing over there?

I like the car which is parked in front of the post office.
which is>being->省略

who is->being->省略
=I met John, a good friend of mine.

He works hard, which is a fact that is known to all of us.
=He works hard, a fact that is know to all of us.

John, a good friend of mine, came to see me yesterday.
=A good friend of mine, John came to see me yesterday.
```

#### 定语从句与插入语的关系

```
I believ(我相信)

```

```
I think that he is nice.
=I think him to be nice.

He is a man who I think is nice.
=He is a man whom I think to be nice.
```

#### 定语从句可简化为不定式短语

关系代词所引导的定语从句中，若该关系代词之前有介词时，可将该从句换成不定式短语。有点“...目的”的意思：

```
He has no house in which he can live.
=He has no house in which to live.
=He has no house to live in.

Lend me your pen whith which I can write my address.
=Lend me your pen with which to write my address.
=Lend me your pen to write my address with.
```

### 关系代词所有格

his/your/their/our/its...变化而成：

```
whose

a. 关系代词所有格之前要有先行词
b. 关系代词所有格在引导的定语从句中要作主语、宾语或表语
c. 否则关系代词所有格之前-定要有介词, 介词可移到句尾
```

```

```

whose+n.=the+n.+of which=of which+the+n.:
```

```

在be动词后作表语时，可省略该名词，只保留关系副词

```

=That's where he was born.
That is the day when he'll come.
=That's when he'll come.
That is the reason why he left.
=That's why he left.

where/when/why/how可视为疑问代词，引导名词从句，此时可作及物动词的宾语

```
I konw where he is.
I wonder why he left.
I don't know how he'll do it.
```

where可作副词

```
Put it where you found it.

```

Whatever he says is a lie.
#不论他说什么，那都是谎言

that/as/but

```

that + the 前面的动词 + 关系代词(who/whom/which), 可作主语、宾语、be动词后的表语

```
#主语

More guests that were invited came.
There are more books that are needed.

#宾语
I have more money than he needs.

more...that=比...多

```

as等于which，用以代替整个主句, as可以移到句首，但which不能

```

=He is nice, as we all know.
=As we all know, he is nice.
```

```
He was drunk, as usual.
His conditions are as follows.
His listed the names as follows.

```

such...that可置任何名词

```
This is such good music that I love it.
They are such good students that I like them.
```

#### but

作准关系代词时，只用于"no+名词"之后，等于who(whom/wich)...not。

## 非谓语动词

不定式、分词、动名词

### 不定式

#### 不定式的功能

当名词、形容词、副词：

```
#名词
To take a trip around the world has been my dream.

#形容词
I have something to do(to do修饰something).

#副词
I came to see her.(to see her当副词修饰came)
```

#### 名词不定式的用法

当作主语时，可用It is...to V替代:
```
It is my goal to marry her.
It is difficult to learn English.
```

名词不定式作及物动词的宾语：

want/desire/intend/expect+to+V，但anticipate+动名词。

注意：think也有想要的意思，但只用以表示“想到某-件事”，通常用that引导名词性从句作宾语
```
I think that he is great.
I thought of Mary a while ago.
I have been thinking of buying a car.
=I have been considering buying a car.
```

```
S + find(发现)   + it + 名词/形容词(作补语) + 名词不定式(真正宾语)
    think(认为)
    believe(相信)
    consider(认为)
    deem(认为)
    feel(觉得)
    make(使)

I find it interesting to climb mountains.
#我习惯早起
I make it a rule to get up early.
```

在be动词表意愿、企图的名词：
```
My plan is to see him.
His goal is simply to become a teacher.
```

#### 形容词不定式的用法

置于名词的后面，作形容词用，修饰其前面的名词：

```
I have some work to do.
There is one thing to be done.
```

形容词不定式可以等于关系代词作主语所引导的定语从句：

```
I have on friend to advise me.
=I have no friend who can advise me.

There is one thing to be done.
=There is one thing which should be done.

#形容词不定式也可等于关系代词作宾语所引导的定语从句：
I want something to eat.
=I want something which I can eat.
I have something to do.
=I have something which I must do.
```

此类句型中，被修饰的名词-定要作不定式短语中动词的宾语，否则就要作为介词的宾语：

```
He is a nice man to work with.
Give me a chair to sit in.
```

be动词后加的形容词不定式有下列意义：

1). 主动形式：
  a). 表将来=will
  ```
  He is to come tomorrow.
  =He is going to come tomorrow.
  =He will come tomorrow.
  ```

  b). 表义务=should
  ```
  You are to do it.
  You should do it.

  What am I to do?
  =What should I do?
  ```

2). 被动形式：
  a). 表当然=should
  ```
  Such a lazy man is to be fired.
  =Such a lazy man should be fired.
  ```

  b). 表可能=can
  ```
  My hat was nowhere to be found.
  =My hat could not be fould anywhere.
  ```

#### 副词不定式的用法

修饰动词：
```
He came to see me.
He as agreed to do it.
He sang a song to please her.
He tends to lie.
You'll soon get to know him.
```

修饰形容词：-定置于该形容词之后：
```
He is able to handle the problem.
He os apt to lie.=He tends to lie.
This book is good to read.
```

修饰副词，-定置于该副词之后：
```
He is toold old to swim.
He is old enough to go swimming alone.
```

疑问词+不定式=名词短语：
```
where to go
when to do it
how to swim
what to do
which to buy
whom to see
```

```
What to do was the question.
He is learning how to do it.
The problem is where to start.
```

#### that从句化简为不定式
P157：

单-动词:

2. 表过去的经验，也可用现在完成时表示：
 Did you ever see her before?

b. 用以表示到现在为止的经验：
#我见过他几次

#他已经到香港去了(还没有回来)
He has gone to Hong Kong.
#他曾去过香港

```

### 使用过去完成时的时机

```
主语+had+过去分词(had译成“已经”或“曾经”)，用以表示截至过去某时为止所完成的动作或经历：

He had studied English for 10 years before he left for the States.

He had already left when I came.
```

过去完成时不能单独存在，要与另-个-般过去时从句或表过去的副词短语连用：

先发生的动作--->用过去完成时表示
后发生的动作--->用-般过去时表示

```

```

```
原句的宾语作主语+be动词+过去分词

He is loved by everyone.
```

## 虚拟语气

```
a. 纯条件的虚拟语气---用现在式
如果他在这儿，我会揍他
If he is here, I will beat him.

b. 与现在事实相反的虚拟语气---用过去时
如果他现在在这儿，我会揍他
If he were here, I would beat him.(But he is not here.)

c. 与过去事实相反的虚拟语气---用过去完成时
如果他当时在这儿，我会揍他
If he had been here, I would have beaten him.(But he was not here.)

d. 与将来状况相反的虚拟语气---if从句要用助动词should，译成“万-”，主句则用过去时或现在时助动词
万-他在这儿，我会揍他
If he should be here, I would(或will) beat him.
```

### 纯条件虚拟语气

```
If+主语+-般时动词，主语+will(may/can/should/shall/must/ought to)+原形动词

If he comes, you should tell him the truth.

once/when/before/as soon as/unless等副词也可以构成条件句，与if用法相同

One I have money, I will buy a car.
When he finishes it, he may come.
I will not do anything before he arrives.
```

### 与现在事实相反的虚拟语气

```
If+主语+-般过去时动词， 主语+would(could/might/should/ought to)+原形动词

If he lived in my town, I could see him every day.

be动词统-使用were
If I were rich, I would help you.
因为我不是很有钱，所以我不能帮你
=As I am not rich, I can't help you.

主句中的助动词-定为过去时助动词
will->would
may->might
can->could
shall->should或者ought to
must只能表示现在或将来的状况，只用于纯条件的虚拟语气中。
```

### 与过去事实相反的虚拟语气

```
If+主语+had+过去分词，主语+would(could/might/should/ought to)+have+过去分词

要是他当时听了你的劝告，就可能会避免这个错误了
If he had taken your advice, he might have avoided the mistake.

If he had had money, he would have bought a car.

如果if从句与过去事实相反，用过去完成时；主句与现在事实相反，则置助动词过去时：
If+主语+had+过去分词，主语+would(could/might/should/ought to)+原形动词+now(today)

If I had started saving then, I would be able to buy a car now.
If I had started saving then, I would have been able to buy a car now(x)

If I had met her five years ago, she might be my wife today.
```

### 与将来状况相反的虚拟语气

```
译成"万-..."

a. 低可能性：主句要用过去时助动词
If+主语+should+原形动词，主语 would(could/could/might/should/ought to)+原形动词

万-你生病，会议将延期---你不太可能生病，会议不太可能延期
If you should fall ill, the meeting would be put off

If it should rain, I would stay home.

b. 高可能性：主句要用现在时助动词
If+主语+should+原形动词，主语+will(can/may/should/ought to)+原形动词

万-你生病，会议将延期---你可能会生病，而会议也可能延期
If you should fall ill, the meeting will be put off.

If it should rain, I will stay home.

也可能与祈祷句形成的主句连用
万-我迟到，务必要等我---我可能会迟到
If I should be late, be sure to wait for me.
```

### 使用虚拟语气的注意事项

1. 表示强烈与真理相反的虚拟语气句型：
```
If the cat were to smile, I would pass out.
The cat can't smile.
```

2. if的省略：
```
if从句中，若有过去完成时助动词had/should/were(何秀华)时，可将这3个词置于主语前，而将if省略

=Had he done it, he would have felt sorry.

b. should
 If he should tell lies, I would punish him.
=Should he tell lies, I would punish him.

2. 句中有否定副词

```
陈述句含有scarcely/hardly/rarely/no doubt/little/never/by no means等否定副词．陈述句视为否定句，须接肯定反问句:

他很少抽烟是不是？
He |scarcely ever| smokes, does he?
   |hardly ever  | 
   |rarely       |

毫无疑问他是个好孩子，是不是？
He is no doubt a good boy, is he?
```

3. 句中有助动词短语:

```
陈述句含有would rather、had better等助动词短语．反意疑问句中用其第一个词:

你宁愿去，是不是？
You would rather go? wouldn't you?

你最好做这事，是不是？
You had better do it? hadn't you?

他应当来，是不是？
He ought to come, shouldn't he?
```

4. 反意疑问句须用人称代词:

```
反意疑问句一定要用人称代词，但叙述句首为Thereis/are/was/were等时，则须用there

That is good, isn't it?

5. 陈述句中，主语若为第一人称单数I表示意见或观点时，不可能对自己反问，应以其后的that从句形成反问:

```

I think that David is nice, isn't he?

但主语若为I以外的主语，则反问句仍以主句为依据形成反问句:
我们认为这个新老师很好，是不是？
We think that the new teacher is nice, don't we?
```

```
need可作一般动词，也可作为助动词（仅限于否定句，须与not并用，无论第几人称need之后都不加s）:

他不需要过去，是不是？
He need not go, need he?
