## 句子的形成

1. S+V
2. 祈使句：

   可以省略主语：
   ```
   Work hard.
   =(You should) work hard.
   Don't fool around.
   ```

### 可作主语的词类

#### 名词
   ```
   Gold is of much value.
   ```

#### 代词
   ```
   It's a lot of fun to climb mountains.
   ```

#### 动名词或不定式短语
   ```
   Seeing him makes me angry.
   To see him is my purpose of coming here.
   ```

   动名词作主语，通常用以表示已知的事实或曾经做过的经历。 
   ```
   Collecting stamps is one of his hobbies
   =It's one of his hobbies (to collect stamps真正主语).

   Listening to music makes me happy.
   =It makes me happy to listen to music.

   It's interesting learning English.(可)
   =It's interesting to learn English.(佳)
   ```

   不定式作主语通常表示一种意愿、目的或未完成的事。
   ```
   To study abroad is my greatest desire.
   =It's my greatest desire to study abroad.
   ```

#### 名词性从句作主语

   可作主语、宾语或在be动词之后作表语。

   ##### that从句

   任何一个主语起首的句子：
   ```
   he doesn't study makes me angry. 
   -> That he doesn't study makes me angry.
   ```

   ##### whether从句

   可用yes/no回答的问句变化而成：
   ```
   Is he happy? 
   -> whether he is happy

   Can he do it? 
   -> whether he can do it.

   Did he come? 
   -> whether he came.

   Does he like it? 
   -> whether he likes it.
   ```

   ##### 疑问词所引导的从句

   由when/what/how/where/why等引导的问句变化而成：
   ```
   What is he doing? 
   -> what he is doing.

   Where can he find it? 
   -> where he can find it.

   What did he write? 
   -> what he wrote.

   When did he come? 
   -> when he came.

   How does he do it? 
   -> how he does it.

   # who/what/which为疑问代词，若在问句中作主语，变成名词性从句时结构不变
   Who came here? 
   -> who came here.

   What happended last night? 
   -> what happended last night.

   Which was bought? 
   -> which was bought.
   ```

   作主语时：
   ```
   That honesty is the best policy is a proverb (which) we should always keep in mind.
   =It's a proverb we should always keep in mind that honesty is the best policy.

   Where he lives is still in doubt.
   =It's still in doubt where he lives.

   Whether he can do it remains to be seen.
   =It remains to be seen whether he can do it.
   ```

   作及物动词的宾语：
   ```
   I wonder whether he has finished the work.
   I don't know how he'll handle it.
   ```

   作介词的宾语：
   ```
   I am worried about whether he can do it.
   I am curious about how he'll cope with the problem.
   ```
   注意：介词后不能直接接that从句，补救方法如下：
   ```
   #建议使用
   I am sure of that the team has won the game.(x)
   I am sure of the fact that the team has won the game.(the fact that).
   ```

   或者不用the fact:
   ```
   I am worried about that he plays around all day.(x)
   I am worried about the fact that he plays around all day.
   I am worried about his(or him) playing around all day.
   ```

   当有do/does/did或者will/would时，予以去掉即可。
   ```
   may -> be likely to
   can -> be able to
   I am happy about that he may come.(x)
   I am happy about his being likely to come.

   I am sure of that he can do it.(x)
   I am surce of his being able to do it.
   ```

   直接去掉介词：
   ```
   #建议使用
   I am worried about that he plays around all day.(x)
   I am worried that he plays around all day.
   ```

   in that
   =because

   except that: 只可惜、除了

   notwithstanding that
   =despite the fact that=in spite of the fact that

   ##### 名词短语作主语：

   疑问副词：
   ```
   where to live
   whether to try again
   when to talk to him
   how to do it
   ```
   
   疑问代词：
   ```
   what to do
   whom to see
   which to buy
   whom to talk to
   ```

   ```
   Where we should meet him is not decided yet.
   =Where to meet him is not decided yet.

   From A to B is about 1000 km.
   =It's about 1000 km from A to B.
   ```

#### 关系代词的省略

限制性定语从句中，若关系代词为及物动词的宾语，则该关系代词可省略。若关系代词为介词的宾语，介词移到定语从句的句尾时，则该关系代词可省略。

```

=He is a man whom I think to be nice.
```

#### 定语从句可简化为不定式短语

关系代词所引导的定语从句中，若该关系代词之前有介词时，可将该从句换成不定式短语。有点“...目的”的意思：

```
He has no house in which he can live.
=He has no house in which to live.
=He has no house to live in.

=Lend me your pen with which to write my address.
