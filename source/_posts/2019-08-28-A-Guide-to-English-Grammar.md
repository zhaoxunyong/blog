## 句子的形成

1. S+V
2. 祈使句：

   可以省略主语：
   ```
   Work hard.=(You should) work hard.
   Don't fool around.
   ```

### 可作主语的词类

1. 名词
   ```
   Gold is of much value.
   ```

2. 代词
   ```
   It's a lot of fun to climb mountains.
   ```

3. 动名词或不定式短语
   ```
   Seeing him makes me angry.
   To see him is my purpose of coming here.
   ```

   动名词作主语，通常用以表示已知的事实或曾经做过的经历。 
   ```
   Collecting stamps is one of his hobbies=It's one of his hobbies (to collect stamps真正主语).
   Listening to music makes me happy=It makes me happy to listen to music.
   It's interesting learning English(可)=It's interesting to learn English.(佳)
   ```

   不定式作主语通常表示一种意愿、目的或未完成的事。
   ```
   To study abroad is my greatest desire=It's my greatest desire to study abroad.
   ```

4. 名词性从句作主语

   可作主语、宾语或在be动词之后作表语。

   1. that从句

   任何一个主语起首的句子：
   ```
   he doesn't study makes me angry. -> That he doesn't study makes me angry.
   ```

   2. whether从句

   可用yes/no回答的问句变化而成：
   ```
   Is he happy? -> whether he is happy
   Can he do it? -> whether he can do it.
   Did he come? -> whether he came.
   Does he like it? -> whether he likes it.
   ```

   3. 疑问词所引导的从句

   由when/what/how/where/why等引导的问句变化而成：
   ```
   What is he doing? -> what he is doing.
   Where can he find it? -> where he can find it.
   What did he write? -> what he wrote.
   When did he come? -> when he came.
   How does he do it? -> how he does it.
   # who/what/which为疑问代词，若在问句中作主语，变成名词性从句时结构不变
   Who came here? -> who came here.
   What happended last night? -> what happended last night.
   Which was bought? -> which was bought.
   ```

   作主语时：
   ```
   That honesty is the best policy is a proverb (which) we should always keep in mind.
   =It's a proverb we should always keep in mind that honesty is the best policy.
   Where he lives is still in doubt.=It's still in doubt where he lives.
   Whether he can do it remains to be seen.=It remains to be seen whether he can do it.
   ```

   作及物动词的宾语：
   ```
   I wonder whether he has finished the work.
   I don't know how he'll handle it.
   ```

   作介词的宾语：
   ```
   I am worried about whether he can do it.
   I am curious about how he'll cope with the problem.
   ```
   注意：介词后不能直接接that从句，补救方法如下：
   ```
   #建议使用
   I am sure of that the team has won the game.(x)
   I am sure of the fact that the team has won the game.(the fact that).
   ```

   或者不用the fact:
   ```
   I am worried about that he plays around all day.(x)
   I am worried about the fact that he plays around all day.
   I am worried about his(or him) playing around all day.
   ```

   当有do/does/did或者will/would时，予以去掉即可。
   ```
   may -> be likely to
   can -> be able to
   I am happy about that he may come.(x)
   I am happy about his being likely to come.

   I am sure of that he can do it.(x)
   I am surce of his being able to do it.
   ```

   直接去掉介词：
   ```
   #建议使用
   I am worried about that he plays around all day.(x)
   I am worried that he plays around all day.
   ```

   in that=because
   except that: 只可惜、除了
   notwithstanding that=despite the fact that=in spite of the fact that

   5. 名词短语作主语：

   疑问副词：
   ```
   where to live
   whether to try again
   when to talk to him
   how to do it
   ```
   
   疑问代词：
   ```
   what to do
   whom to see
   which to buy
   whom to talk to
   ```

   ```
   Where we should meet him is not decided yet.
   =Where to meet him is not decided yet.
   From A to B is about 1000 km.
   =It's about 1000 km from A to B.
   ```
