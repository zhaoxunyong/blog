## 句子的形成

1. S+V
2. 祈使句：

   可以省略主语：
   ```
   Work hard.
   =(You should) work hard.
   Don't fool around.
   ```

### 可作主语的词类

#### 名词
   ```
   Gold is of much value.
   ```

#### 代词
   ```
   It's a lot of fun to climb mountains.
   ```

#### 动名词或不定式短语
   ```
   Seeing him makes me angry.
   To see him is my purpose of coming here.
   ```

   动名词作主语，通常用以表示已知的事实或曾经做过的经历。 
   ```
   Collecting stamps is one of his hobbies
   =It's one of his hobbies (to collect stamps真正主语).

   Listening to music makes me happy.
   =It makes me happy to listen to music.

   It's interesting learning English.(可)
   =It's interesting to learn English.(佳)
   ```

   不定式作主语通常表示一种意愿、目的或未完成的事。
   ```
   To study abroad is my greatest desire.
   =It's my greatest desire to study abroad.
   ```

#### 名词性从句作主语

   可作主语、宾语或在be动词之后作表语。

   ##### that从句

   任何一个主语起首的句子：
   ```
   he doesn't study makes me angry. 
   -> That he doesn't study makes me angry.
   ```

   ##### whether从句

   可用yes/no回答的问句变化而成：
   ```
   Is he happy? 
   -> whether he is happy

   Can he do it? 
   -> whether he can do it.

   Did he come? 
   -> whether he came.

   Does he like it? 
   -> whether he likes it.
   ```

   ##### 疑问词所引导的从句

   由when/what/how/where/why等引导的问句变化而成：
   ```
   What is he doing? 
   -> what he is doing.

   Where can he find it? 
   -> where he can find it.

   What did he write? 
   -> what he wrote.

   When did he come? 
   -> when he came.

   How does he do it? 
   -> how he does it.

   # who/what/which为疑问代词，若在问句中作主语，变成名词性从句时结构不变
   Who came here? 
   -> who came here.

   What happended last night? 
   -> what happended last night.

   Which was bought? 
   -> which was bought.
   ```

   作主语时：
   ```
   That honesty is the best policy is a proverb (which) we should always keep in mind.
   =It's a proverb we should always keep in mind that honesty is the best policy.

   Where he lives is still in doubt.
   =It's still in doubt where he lives.

   Whether he can do it remains to be seen.
   =It remains to be seen whether he can do it.
   ```

   作及物动词的宾语：
   ```
   I wonder whether he has finished the work.
   I don't know how he'll handle it.
   ```

   作介词的宾语：
   ```
   I am worried about whether he can do it.
   I am curious about how he'll cope with the problem.
   ```
   注意：介词后不能直接接that从句，补救方法如下：
   ```
   #建议使用
   I am sure of that the team has won the game.(x)
   I am sure of the fact that the team has won the game.(the fact that).
   ```

   或者不用the fact:
   ```
   I am worried about that he plays around all day.(x)
   I am worried about the fact that he plays around all day.
   I am worried about his(or him) playing around all day.
   ```

   当有do/does/did或者will/would时，予以去掉即可。
   ```
   may -> be likely to
   can -> be able to
   I am happy about that he may come.(x)
   I am happy about his being likely to come.

   I am sure of that he can do it.(x)
   I am surce of his being able to do it.
   ```

   直接去掉介词：
   ```
   #建议使用
   I am worried about that he plays around all day.(x)
   I am worried that he plays around all day.
   ```

   in that
   =because

   except that: 只可惜、除了

   notwithstanding that
   =despite the fact that=in spite of the fact that

   ##### 名词短语作主语：

   疑问副词：
   ```
   where to live
   whether to try again
   when to talk to him
   how to do it
   ```
   
   疑问代词：
   ```
   what to do
   whom to see
   which to buy
   whom to talk to
   ```

   ```
   Where we should meet him is not decided yet.
   =Where to meet him is not decided yet.

   From A to B is about 1000 km.
   =It's about 1000 km from A to B.
   ```

#### 关系代词的省略

限制性定语从句中，若关系代词为及物动词的宾语，则该关系代词可省略。若关系代词为介词的宾语，介词移到定语从句的句尾时，则该关系代词可省略。

```

#### 定语从句可简化为不定式短语

=He has no house to live in.

引导名词性从句，无逗号相隔，表是否。

```

### 准关系代词

that/as/but

```

```

#### that

that + the 前面的动词 + 关系代词(who/whom/which), 可作主语、宾语、be动词后的表语

```
#主语

that=that the money which，所以that中已经包含了主语，不用再添加主语
More guests that were invited came.
There are more books that are needed.

#宾语
I have more money than he needs.

more...that=比...多

#be词语后的表语

#我有一本书，与他正在看的那一本相同
I have the same book as he is reading.
#我借了一本书，就是他上周借的那一本

```

as等于which，用以代替整个主句, as可以移到句首，但which不能

```
He is nice, which we all know.
=He is nice, as we all know.
=As we all know, he is nice.
```

```
He was drunk, as usual.
His conditions are as follows.
His listed the names as follows.
```

只能与单数可数名词使用的结构：

```

such...that可置任何名词

```

```

#### but

作准关系代词时，只用于"no+名词"之后，等于who(whom/wich)...not。

## 非谓语动词

不定式、分词、动名词

### 不定式

#### 不定式的功能

当名词、形容词、副词：

```
#名词
To take a trip around the world has been my dream.

#形容词
I have something to do(to do修饰something).

#副词
I came to see her.(to see her当副词修饰came)
```

#### 名词不定式的用法

当作主语时，可用It is...to V替代:
```
It is my goal to marry her.
It is difficult to learn English.
```

名词不定式作及物动词的宾语：

want/desire/intend/expect+to+V，但anticipate+动名词。

注意：think也有想要的意思，但只用以表示“想到某一件事”，通常用that引导名词性从句作宾语
```
I think that he is great.
I thought of Mary a while ago.
I have been thinking of buying a car.
=I have been considering buying a car.
```

```
S + find(发现)   + it + 名词/形容词(作补语) + 名词不定式(真正宾语)
    think(认为)
    believe(相信)
    consider(认为)
    deem(认为)
    feel(觉得)
    make(使)

I find it interesting to climb mountains.
#我习惯早起
I make it a rule to get up early.
```

在be动词表意愿、企图的名词：
```
My plan is to see him.
His goal is simply to become a teacher.
```

#### 形容词不定式的用法

置于名词的后面，作形容词用，修饰其前面的名词：

```
I have some work to do.
There is one thing to be done.
```

形容词不定式可以等于关系代词作主语所引导的定语从句：

```
I have on friend to advise me.
=I have no friend who can advise me.

There is one thing to be done.
=There is one thing which should be done.

#形容词不定式也可等于关系代词作宾语所引导的定语从句：
I want something to eat.
=I want something which I can eat.
I have something to do.
=I have something which I must do.
```

此类句型中，被修饰的名词一定要作不定式短语中动词的宾语，否则就要作为介词的宾语：

```
He is a nice man to work with.
Give me a chair to sit in.
```

be动词后加的形容词不定式有下列意义：

1). 主动形式：
  a). 表将来=will
  ```
  He is to come tomorrow.
  =He is going to come tomorrow.
  =He will come tomorrow.
  ```

  b). 表义务=should
  ```
  You are to do it.
  You should do it.

  What am I to do?
  =What should I do?
  ```

2). 被动形式：
  a). 表当然=should
  ```
  Such a lazy man is to be fired.
  =Such a lazy man should be fired.
  ```

  b). 表可能=can
  ```
  My hat was nowhere to be found.
  =My hat could not be fould anywhere.
  ```

#### 副词不定式的用法

修饰动词：
```
He came to see me.
He as agreed to do it.
He sang a song to please her.
He tends to lie.
You'll soon get to know him.
```

修饰形容词：一定置于该形容词之后：
```
He is able to handle the problem.
He os apt to lie.=He tends to lie.
This book is good to read.
```

修饰副词，一定置于该副词之后：
```
He is toold old to swim.
He is old enough to go swimming alone.
```

疑问词+不定式=名词短语：
```
where to go
when to do it
how to swim
what to do
which to buy
whom to see
```

```
What to do was the question.
He is learning how to do it.
The problem is where to start.
```

#### that从句化简为不定式
P157：

单一动词:
```
It seems that he works hard.
=He semms(appears) to work hard.

#我刚巧在那里

It is reported: 据报道
It is rumored: 谣传
It is known: 据了解
It is thought: 一般认为
It is believed: 一般相信
=He is said(reported/...) to be good.

It appears that they are nice.
=they appear to be nice.

It was said that he loved music very much.
=He was said to love music very much.

It is said they love music very much.

```

```
It seems that he worked hard.
=He seems to have worked hard.

It is said that he was a thug(流氓) in the past.
=He is said to have been a thug in the past.
```

to be的省略：
```
He seems to be nice.
=He seems nice.
```

prove+to be:
```
#表证明：接名词或名词性从句作宾
The investigation proved his guilt.
=The investigation proved that he was guilty.

#to be: 表显示、结果是：
#他的话竟然是真的
What he said proved to be true.

#这份报告结果是错的
The report proved to be false.
=The report proved false.
=The report turned out to be false.
=The report turned out false.
```

#### 使役动词加不定式短语作宾语补语

```
To please my father is hard.
=My father is hard to please.

To get along with him is easy.
=He is easy to get along with.

#### 分词结构-单句化简法

### 使用过去时的时机

主语+一般过去时动词

```
1. 表过去的动作、习惯、状态：
I saw him yesterday.
He always rose early in the morning.
He was born in 1970

2. 表过去的经验，也可用现在完成时表示：
 Did you ever see her before?
=Have you ever seen her before?

3. 句中若有after/until/before等连词引导的从句，由于时间先后很清楚，可用一般过去时代替过去完成时：
 After I had finished the work, I went home.
=After I finished the work, I went home.
#我搬来这里之前曾在日本住过很长一段时间
 Before I moved here, I had lived in Japan for a long time.
=Before I moved here, I lived in Japan for a long time. 
```

### 使用现在完成时的时机

主语+have+过去分词(have译成“已经”或“曾经”)：

```

a. 用以表示到现在为止完成的动作：
I have just finished my homework.

b. 用以表示到现在为止的经验：
#我见过他几次
I have met him several times.
#我从未见过像他这样的人
I have never met such a man as he.

c. 表曾去过的经历用：have been，表已经到了某个地方：have gone
#他已经到香港去了(还没有回来)
He has gone to Hong Kong.
#他曾去过香港
He has been to Hong Kong.
```

### 使用过去完成时的时机

```
主语+had+过去分词(had译成“已经”或“曾经”)，用以表示截至过去某时为止所完成的动作或经历：

He had studied English for 10 years before he left for the States.

He had already left when I came.
```

过去完成时不能单独存在，要与另一个一般过去时从句或表过去的副词短语连用：

先发生的动作--->用过去完成时表示
后发生的动作--->用一般过去时表示

```
I lost the book which my father had given me.
```

### 使用将来完成时的时机

主语+will+have+过去分词(will have译成“将已经”), 用以表示到将来某时为止所完成或仍在继续的动作或经历等：

```
#他将已抵达芝加哥
He will have arrived in Chicago by this time tomorrow.
#他就在此住满10年了
He will have lived here for 10 years by the end of this month.
```

### 使用现在进行时的时机

主语+be动词+现在分词(正在...)，不过也可以表示即将发生的动作，常与表将来的副词连用：此时be动词译成：即将...

```
#他即将于今天来
 He is coming today.
=He will be coming today.

 They are leaving soon.
=They will be leaving soon.
```

They have been standing here since 7 this morning.
```

```
I had been sleeping when he came.
He told us that he had been studying German since 2001.
```

### 使用将来完成进行时的时机

主语+will have been+现在分词(will have been译成“将一直在”)，表一直继续到将来某时，而仍将继续进行的动作：

```
到今年年底，我教英语将已有10年了
I will have been teaching English for ten years by the end of this year.
```

### “for+一段时间”与完成时的关系

```
for            the |past| five years    过去5年来
during             |last|
in
through
down through
over
=since five years ago    自从5年前起
这些短语与现在完成时或现在完成进行时连用
#过去两个星期来，我都一直在学英语
I have been studying English for the past two weeks.
```

### since与完成时的关系

since与"for+一段时间"使用差不多，不过注意：

since之后须接明确的某段时间作宾语，不要接一段时间作宾语，若之后有一段时间，则须在一段时间之后接ago:
```
Peter has lived here since 2002.
Peter has lived here since two years ago.
```

现在完成时或现在完成进行时的动词与“for+一段时间”连用时，该动词所表示的动作必须可接续进行，否则就不可与“for+一段时间”连用：
```

He has died for two months.(x)

=It is two months since he died.
=Two months have passed since he died.

He has married Jane for twenty years.(x)
=He has married Jane.
=It is twenty years since he married Jane.
=Twenty years have passed since he married Jane.
```

### 语态

语态有两种：主动与被动。形成被动语态一定是及物动词：

```
原句的宾语作主语+be动词+过去分词
Everyone loves him.
He is loved by everyone.
```

## 虚拟语气

```
a. 纯条件的虚拟语气---用现在式
如果他在这儿，我会揍他
If he is here, I will beat him.

b. 与现在事实相反的虚拟语气---用过去时
如果他现在在这儿，我会揍他
If he were here, I would beat him.(But he is not here.)

c. 与过去事实相反的虚拟语气---用过去完成时
如果他当时在这儿，我会揍他
If he had been here, I would have beaten him.(But he was not here.)

d. 与将来状况相反的虚拟语气---if从句要用助动词should，译成“万一”，主句则用过去时或现在时助动词
万一他在这儿，我会揍他
If he should be here, I would(或will) beat him.
```

### 纯条件虚拟语气

```
If+主语+一般时动词，主语+will(may/can/should/shall/must/ought to)+原形动词

If he comes, you should tell him the truth.

once/when/before/as soon as/unless等副词也可以构成条件句，与if用法相同

One I have money, I will buy a car.
When he finishes it, he may come.
I will not do anything before he arrives.
```

### 与现在事实相反的虚拟语气

```
If+主语+一般过去时动词， 主语+would(could/might/should/ought to)+原形动词

If he lived in my town, I could see him every day.

be动词统一使用were
If I were rich, I would help you.
因为我不是很有钱，所以我不能帮你
=As I am not rich, I can't help you.

主句中的助动词一定为过去时助动词
will->would
may->might
can->could
shall->should或者ought to
must只能表示现在或将来的状况，只用于纯条件的虚拟语气中。
```

### 与过去事实相反的虚拟语气

```
If+主语+had+过去分词，主语+would(could/might/should/ought to)+have+过去分词

要是他当时听了你的劝告，就可能会避免这个错误了
If he had taken your advice, he might have avoided the mistake.

If he had had money, he would have bought a car.

如果if从句与过去事实相反，用过去完成时；主句与现在事实相反，则置助动词过去时：
If+主语+had+过去分词，主语+would(could/might/should/ought to)+原形动词+now(today)

If I had started saving then, I would be able to buy a car now.
If I had started saving then, I would have been able to buy a car now(x)

If I had met her five years ago, she might be my wife today.
```

### 与将来状况相反的虚拟语气

```
译成"万-..."

a. 低可能性：主句要用过去时助动词
If+主语+should+原形动词，主语 would(could/could/might/should/ought to)+原形动词

万一你生病，会议将延期---你不太可能生病，会议不太可能延期
If you should fall ill, the meeting would be put off

If it should rain, I would stay home.

b. 高可能性：主句要用现在时助动词
If+主语+should+原形动词，主语+will(can/may/should/ought to)+原形动词

万一你生病，会议将延期---你可能会生病，而会议也可能延期
If you should fall ill, the meeting will be put off.

If it should rain, I will stay home.

也可能与祈祷句形成的主句连用
万一我迟到，务必要等我---我可能会迟到
If I should be late, be sure to wait for me.
```

### 使用虚拟语气的注意事项

1. 表示强烈与真理相反的虚拟语气句型：
```
If the cat were to smile, I would pass out.
The cat can't smile.
```

2. if的省略：
```
if从句中，若有过去完成时助动词had/should/were(何秀华)时，可将这3个词置于主语前，而将if省略

a. had
 If he had done it, he would have felt sorry.
=Had he done it, he would have felt sorry.

b. should
 If he should tell lies, I would punish him.
=Should he tell lies, I would punish him.

 If he were lazy, he might fail.
=Were he lazy, he might fail. 
```

3. 可取代if的其他连词：
```
in case(that): 万一
on condition that: 如果

Any book will do as long as it is interesting.

```

2. 一般比较：than

```
他比彼得用功
He is more diligent than Peter.

他没有彼特更用功
He doesn't study harder than Peter.
```

### 一般比较结构

1. 造句方式：

```
a. 先造一个含有形容词或副词的句子：

他很小心
He is prudent.
他工作很热心
He works enthusiastically.

b. 再将句中形容词或副词变成比较级：
他比较小心
He is more prudent.
他工作比较不热心
He works less enthusiastically.

c. 再设定比较对象，并在该比较对象之前置副词连词than：
He is more prudent than Peter.
He works less enthusiastically than Peter.
```

2. than引导的状语从句结构变化：

```
若有be动词、助动词可保留，若有一般动词以do/does/did代替，当然这些也可以省略。

a. be动词
他没有你负责任
He is less responsible than you (are).

b. 助动词
他唱歌比你悦耳
He can sing more beautifully than you (can).

c. 一般动词
他工作比你仔细
He worked more carefully than you (did).
```

3. less之后的副词或形容词均使用原级：

```
他没有John勤奋
He is less hardworking than John.

他没有John那么常来看我们
He visits us less often than John.

他做事没有John那么小心
He does things less carefully than John.
```

4. 与本身作比较：

```
他比以前用功
He studies hander than he did before.

她看来比较实际年轻
She looks younger than she is.

a. 自行比较时，句中的时态若不同：
1). be动词
他比以前健康(不同时态)
He is healthier than he was.

2). 助动词
他比以前唱歌好(不同时态)
He can sing better than he could.

3). 一般动词

他比以前努力
He work hander than he did.
                    he used to.

b. 此类中若有对等的介词短语,than之后的主语及动词或助动词都可以省略：
1) 介词短语
他和玛丽在一起比和简在一起快乐
 He is happier with Mary than He is with Jane.
=He is happier with Mary than with Jane.

他对英文比对日文有兴趣
He is more interesting in English than (he is) in Janpanese. 
2) when从句
他比我十年前看见他时瘦多了
He is thinner than (he was) when I saw him ten years ago.
```

5. 比较结构中相同动词的化简

```
我比他爱你
 I love you more than he loves you.
=I love you more than he does you.
=I love you more than he does.
```

6. 数量形容词的比较级变化：
   数量形容词：much/little/many/few

```
a. much(很多的)及little(很少的)修饰不可数名词：
原级    比较级  最高级
much    more   the most
little  less   the least

他有很多钱
 He has very much money.
=He has a lot of money.(佳)
肯定式中用very much或a lot of，否定式中则使用much

他比John有钱
He has more money than John (does).

他是所有人中最有钱的
He has the most money of all.

他的时间很少
He has little time.

他做这工作的时间比我的少
He has less time than I (do) for the job.

他的时间最少

他有很多朋友
He has many friends.

他的朋友比John的多
He has more friends than John.

他的朋友最多
He has the most friends of all.

他的朋友很少
He has few friends.

他的朋友比John的少
He has fewer friends than John.

他的朋友最少
He has the fewest friends of all.
```

7. 避免错误比较

```
这个篮子里的苹果比桌子上的那些要甜(与介词短语those比较)
The apples in this basket are sweeter than those on the table.

他的车子比他的朋友的好
His car better than his friend's.
```

8. 本身最高级意味的形容词：

```
已经是最高级的意味，不能使用比较级：
perfect: 完美的
sublime: 卓越的
noble: 高贵的
extreme: 极度的
superb: 极好的
excellent: 特优的
```

9. 变得愈来愈...

```
 be getting more and more + adj.
=be getting 比较级adj+and+比较级adj.
=be getting increasingly+adj.

Life over there are getting more and more difficult.
                            increasingly difficult.

那个男孩越来越胖了

                   increasingly fat.
```

10. 修饰比较级的副词

```
置于被修饰的副词或形容词前：far/much/a lot/a great deal/still/even，其中far/much/a lot最常用

这问题比那个要难多了/甚至更难
This question is (far/much/a lot) more fifficult than than one.

他比他们之中任何一个都用功得多
He studies much harder than anyone of them.

far/much/a lot可修饰副词too：
他太老了，无法做这差事
He is far/much/a lot too old to do the work.
```

11. 最高级的副词

```
有两个：most及least

a. 形容词

她是我见过最美的女孩

Of the three girls, she is the least beautiful.

b. 副词

他待人最有礼貌

c. 动词

```

12. 最高级一定要是三者以上：

```
a. Of/among the three/four... 在这三个/四个...之中

这五本书中，我最喜欢那本
Of five books, I like that one best.

他是所有学生中最好的一个
He is the best student of all.

of the two则使用比较级
这两个学生中，John比较好
Of the two students, John is the better.

这两本书中，我比较喜欢那本
Of the two books, I like that one better.

b. 最高级形容词+n+关系代词that(不可使用who/whom/which)+定语从句完成时：

John is the most responsible man (that) I've ever known.

在我教过的学生中，他是最好的一位
He is the best students that I've ever taught.
```

13. the与最高级的关系：

```
最高级副词修饰动词或副词时，不一定要加the，但最高级形容词修饰名词时，则须加the:

a. 副词
这四个学生中，他待人最有礼
Of the four students, he treats people (the) most politely.

b. 动词
我所认识的人中，我最尊敬他
Of all the people I know, I respect him (the) most.
I respect him most that I've ever known.

c. 名词
他是所有学生当中最好的一个
He is the best student of all.
```

14. most可作very解：

```
加形容词修饰名词时，不必于most之前加the:
她真是个很美的女孩子
She is a most/very beautiful girl.
```

15. by far可修饰最高级：

```
by far及much修饰the+最高级副词或形容词：
她是镇上最美的女孩子
She is by far/much the most beautiful girl in town.
```

## 原级比较结构

1. 造句方式：

```
as...as...: 和...一样地...

a. 先造一个含有形容词或副词的句子：
He is prudent.
He runs fast.

b. 再于句中的形容词或副词之前置as一词as为副词，译成“一样地” ：
他一样地小心
He is as prudent.
He runs as fast.

c. 再设定比较对象，并在该比较对象之前置副词连接词as即告完成；此as译成
“和” ：
他和约翰一样小心
He is as prudent as John.
他跑得和约翰一样快
He runs as fast as John.
```

2. as从句的变化

```
a. be动词
他和约翰一样小心

b. 助动词
他唱得和约翰一样好
He can sing as well as John (can)

c. 一般动词
他跑得和约翰一样快
He runs as fast as John.

他和我妹妹玛丽一样用功
He studies as hand as does Mary, who is my sister. 

他比我妹妹玛丽用功多了
He studies much hander than does Mary, who is my sister.
```

4. "as...as..."用于肯定或否定句，而"so...as..."则只能用在否定句中

```
肯定句：
He studies as hard as Mary.
他和栏杆一样瘦
He is as thin as a rail.

否定句：
He doesn't study as(so) hard as Mary.
He isn't as(so) polite as John.

## 其他有关as/than的重要用法

1. "as...as..."可与单数可数名词连用：

```
#将第一个as置于动词之后：
He is as handsome a boy as John.
I have as fancy a car as that one.

1). 类似此种只能与单数名词连用的结构还有：

so...that...:  如此...以致/所以...
too...to...    太...而不...
how...         多么地...

a. so...that...
他是个这么好的男孩子，所以我非常喜欢他

b. too...to...
他年纪太大，没法做此事

这真是好听的音乐(不可数)
What beautiful music it is!
他们真是好孩子(复数)
What good boys they are!
He is such a good boy that I like him.
They are such good boys that I like them.

这类只能与单数可数名词连用的结构记忆法：

一个叫土土(too...to...)，三人相聚时，最爱念一个字：好(how...)
```

2. as...as one can 尽可能地...
   =as...as possible

```
a. 造句方法：
1) 先造一个含有形容词或副词的句子：

You must study hard.
他保持沉默
He remained quiet.

2). 在hard或quiet之前置入第一个as(用副词，中文译为"一样地")：
You must study as hard.
He remained as quite.

3). 句尾添加as one(you/he...) can或possible:
你要尽可能地用功
You must study as hard as you can.
                       as possible.
He remained as quiet as he could.
                     as possible.
```

```
more...that结构中两个形容词比较，一律用原级：
 He is more good than bad.
=He is not so bad as good.
=He is good rather than bad.
```

7. 倍数词造句法：

```
a. 本结构一共有四种：
倍数词＋as⋯as⋯                           是⋯的几倍
morethan＋倍数词＋as⋯as⋯                 是⋯的几倍还不止
倍数词＋the（或所有格）＋名词是⋯ ⋯的几倍

He has my money.
2. 再将倍数置于所有格之前
He has twice my money.

3. more than+倍数词+the(或所有格)+名词    是...的几倍还不止
他的钱是我的两位还不止
